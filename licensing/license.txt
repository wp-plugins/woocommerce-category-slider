gVectors.com grantes you a Single-Site License for this product.

A Single-Site License provides support for ONE instance of the gVectors Product(s) that you purchase. 
Perfect for site owners with only one domain name. However, please note… if you run a WordPress® Multisite Network, 
with an gVectors Product activated on multiple child blogs or sub-sites within your Network (regardless of whether you use sub-domains or sub-directories), 
this will always require our Unlimited-Site License, because gVectors Product runs as a separate instance on each child blog or sub-site in the Network. 
To clarify, a Single-Site License does NOT provide support for multiple child blogs or sub-sites, even if they do run within a single Multisite Network installation of WordPress®.
